# C++ STL Algorithms Cheat Sheet

The C++ Standard Template Library provides algorithms for functions that are commonly needed in everyday-scenarios, and for commonly used containerss.

Now, I'm sure you're a gr8 coder and all and could write your own functions, but you should probably use the Standard Library's functions whenever possible. They're very efficient, both memory and space wise, especially if you use STL containers.

The rest of this README is going to contain short explanations of each STL algorithm, as well as very concise sample code showing how to use the algorithms. Star/bookmark this repository and use it as a reference.

You can also watch [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/9XGqSDjaW24) as a guide for how to best use this resource (since it'll also teach you the prerequisites you'll need to learn and also goes over a few examples).

## Prerequisites: Pairs, Lambda Expressions, and Iterators

To truly understand how to use the STL algorithms, you should know how STL `pair`s, lambda expressions, and iterators work.

If you don't know how they work (or even if you do), I strongly recommend that you read [this short blog post](https://www.srcmake.com/home/cpp-stl-algorithms) about how they work, since they're used in the STL algorithms and you won't understand how to use the algorithms without them.

## Base Code and C++ version

For the sake of testing this code, we'll specify a very basic C++ file that our code would run in. Note that we include `vector`, because that's the container the examples will use, we're including `iostream` for `cout`, and we including `algorithm` for the actual STL algorithms.

#### main.cpp

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
	{
	// INSERT STD:ALGORITHM EXAMPLE CODE HERE

	return 0;
	}
```

We'll use a simple makefile to compile and run, specifying C++11.

#### makefile

```
all:
	g++ main.cpp -std=c++11 -o run
	./run
```

And so to actually run this code, in a UNIX operating system, in the terminal, simply type `make` in the directory where your makefile and main.cpp are.

---

### remove

For a range, removes any element that has a certain value (that you specify). This is done by moving a valid element into the removed element's spot. (The container size does not change.)

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::remove(v.begin(), v.end(), 2);

// v is now { 1 3 4 5 5 }

// 'it' points to the element after the first 5 in v.
```

---

### remove_if

For a range, removes any element that passes a certain condition (that you specify). This is done by moving a valid element into the removed element's spot. (The container size does not change.) You'll know where the updated range ends by checking where the returned iterator is. Order is not preserved, and the extra elements at the end of the range are in some valid state.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, an iterator to the end of the range, and a lambda function that returns a bool.
- Returns an iterator after the last valid element in the range.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

auto lambdaIsOdd = [](int i) { return i % 2 != 0; };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::remove_if(v.begin(), v.end(), lambdaIsOdd);

// v is now { 2 4 3 4 5 }

// 'it' points to the element after the first 4 in v.
```

---

### remove_copy

For a given range, copies each element into a new range, except for elements with a certain value (that you specify). The original range is untouched.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the original range, an iterator to the end of the original range, an iterator to the beginning of the copy range, and the value that you want to skip.
- Returns an iterator after the last valid element in the copy range.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
std::vector<int> res(5);

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::remove_copy(v.begin(), v.end(), res.begin(), 2);

// v is now { 1 3 4 5 0 } // (The zero is from the initialization.)

// 'it' points to the element after the 5 in res
```

---

- Returns an iterator after the last valid element in the copy range.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
std::vector<int> res(5);

auto lambdaIsOdd = [](int i) { return i % 2 != 0; };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::remove_copy_if(v.begin(), v.end(), res.begin(), lambdaIsOdd);

// v is now { 2 4 0 0 0 } // (The zeroes are from the initialization.)

// 'it' points to the element after the 4 in res
```

---

### unique

For a range, remove consecutive duplicate elements. (Ex. { 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 3 } -> { 2 3 4 3 ? ? ? ? } ) This is done by moving a valid element into the removed element's spot. (The container size does not change.) You'll know where the updated range ends by checking where the returned iterator is. Order is not preserved, and the extra elements at the end of the range are in some valid state.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns an iterator after the last valid element in the range.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::unique(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is now { 2 3 4 3 4 4 4 3 }

// 'it' points to the element after the second 3 in v.
```

---

### unique_copy

For a range, copies all elements that don't have a duplicate neighbor into a new range (that you specify). (Ex. { 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 3 } -> { 2 3 4 3 } ) The original range is untouched.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the original range, an iterator to the end of the original range, and an iterator to the beginning of the copy range.
- Returns an iterator after the last copied element in the copy range.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3 };
std::vector<int> res(8);

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::unique_copy(v.begin(), v.end(), res.begin());

// v is still { 2 3 4 3 4 4 4 3 }
// res is now { 2 3 4 3 0 0 0 0 } (The zeroes are from initialization.)

// 'it' points to the element after the second 3 in res.
```

---

### reverse

For a range, reverses the order of the elements. (Ex. { 1 2 3 4 } -> { 4 3 2 1 } .)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };

std::reverse(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is { 4 3 2 1 }
```

---

### reverse_copy

For a range, copies the elements in verse order into a new range (that you specify). (Ex. { 1 2 3 4 } -> { 4 3 2 1 } .) The original range is untouched.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the original range, an iterator to the end of the original range, and an iterator to the beginning of the copy range.

// v is { 1 2 3 4 }
// res is { 4 3 2 1 }
// 'it' points to the element after 1 in res
```

---

### rotate

For a range, rotates the elements (in a circular fashion) so that a specified becomes the new first element, and every other element is shifted over.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, an iterator to the element we want to be the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin() + 2; // Points to 3

std::rotate(v.begin(), it, v.end());

// v is now { 3 4 1 2 }
```

---

### rotate_copy

For a range, copies the elements into a new range if the elements were rotating (in a circular fashion) so that a specified becomes the new first element, and every other element is shifted over. The original range is untouched.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the original range, an iterator to the element we want to be the beginning of the copy range. an iterator to the end of the original range, and an iterator to the beginning of the copy range.
- Returns an iterator after the last copied element in the copy range.

```

std::vector<int>::iterator it2 = std::rotate_copy(v.begin(), it1, v.end(), res.begin());

// v is still { 1 2 3 4 }
// res is { 3 4 1 2 }
// 'it2' points to the element after 2 in res
```

---

### random_shuffle

For a range, rearranges the elements randomly. (`random_shuffle` uses `rand()` as the random number generator.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };

std::random_shuffle(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is { 1 4 2 3 }
```

---

### shuffle

For a range, rearranges the elements randomly using a uniform random number generator (that you must provide).

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range, and a random number generator.
- Returns void.

You should really be using `random` or some other library to provide a random number generator. Since the code example isn't simple, I'll just provide a link to [cplusplus.com's shuffle page](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/shuffle/) for sample code..

# Partitioned

Operate on partioned data, which is split in half based on a certain condition.

---

### is_partitioned

Check if the data in a range is partitioned according to a condition you specify. (Ex. Are the odd elements separated from the even elements?)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, an iterator to the end of the range, and a lambda that returns a bool.
- Returns a bool. True if the data is in the beginning all return true and the data afterward all return false. Returns false otherwise.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 1, 8, 4, 6 };

auto lambdaIsOdd = [](int i) { return i % 2 != 0; };

bool isPartitioned = std::is_partitioned(v.begin(), v.end(), lambdaIsOdd); // true
```

Note that if the data is all false and then all true, `is_partitioned` will return false. Make sure your lambda will return "true" for the front data. For example..

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 1, 8, 4, 6 };

auto lambdaIsEven = [](int i) { return i % 2 == 0; };

bool isPartitioned = std::is_partitioned(v.begin(), v.end(), lambdaIsEven); // false
```

isPartitioned is false even though the data is clearly partitioned. That's because the first partition returns false and the second partition returns true.

---

### partition

Rearranges the elements in a range so that the first group returns true for the condition you specify. (Ex. Move all odd elements to the front.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, an iterator to the end of the range, and a lambda that returns a bool.
- Returns an iterator to the first element of the second partition.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };

auto lambdaIsOdd = [](int i) { return i % 2 != 0; };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::partition(v.begin(), v.end(), lambdaIsOdd);

// v is now { 1 7 3 5 4 6 2 }
```

---

### stable_partition

Rearranges the elements in a range so that the first group returns true for the condition you specify. (Ex. Move all odd elements to the front.) Order is preserved.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, an iterator to the end of the range, and a lambda that returns a bool.
- Returns an iterator to the first element of the second partition.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };

auto lambdaIsOdd = [](int i) { return i % 2 != 0; };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::stable_partition(v.begin(), v.end(), lambdaIsOdd);

// v is now { 1 3 5 7 2 4 6 }
```

---

### partition_copy

For a range, copies the data which is true for a condition we specify into some range, and copies the data that is false into some other range.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the original range, an iterator to the end of the original range, an iterator to the beginning of the "true" range, an iterator to the end of the "false" range, and a lambda that returns a bool.
- Returns a `pair` of iterators to the element after the last entered element for each of the copy ranges.

```
std::vector<int> v1{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };
std::vector<int> v2(7);
std::vector<int> v3(7);

auto lambdaIsOdd = [](int i) { return i % 2 != 0; };

std::pair<std::vector<int>::iterator, std::vector<int>::iterator> p = std::partition_copy(v1.begin(), v1.end(), v2.begin(), v3.begin(), lambdaIsOdd);

// v2 is now { 1 3 5 7 0 0 0 } (The zeroes are from initialization.)
// v3 is now { 2 4 6 0 0 0 0 } (The zeroes are from initialization.)
```

---

### partition_point

Get the first element in a partitioned range that returns false for a given condition. (The element that begins the partition.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, an iterator to the end of the range, and a lambda that returns a bool.
- Returns an iterator to the element.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 1, 8, 4, 6 };

auto lambdaIsOdd = [](int i) { return i % 2 != 0; };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::partition_point(v.begin(), v.end(), lambdaIsOdd);
// Points to 8
```

# Sorting

Sorting data.

---

### sort

Sort the elements in a container for the given range.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 7, 2, 1 };

std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is now { 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 }.
```

---

### stable_sort

Sort the elements in a container for the given range, but the sort is stable.

A "stable" sort means that for equal elements, an element that was ahead of another before the sort will be ahead after the sort.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 7, 3, 2, 1 }; // { 5, 3a, 7, 3b, 2, 1 }

std::stable_sort(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is now { 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 5, 7 }
```

Stable sort is best used for objects.

---

### partial_sort

For a position in a range, make sure all the elements from the beginning of the range up to that position are the smallest elements in the range and are sorted. (The rest of the elements (which are up to the position until the end of the range) aren't in any specific order.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range, and an iterator to the position we want to partially sort for.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 9, 4 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin() + 3;

std::partial_sort(v.begin(), v.end(), it);

// v ends up as { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
```

In the code example, v ends up fully sorted, but only the first three elements are guaranteed to be sorted.

---

### partial_sort_copy

Copies the items from a range into a second range, in sorted order.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the first range, and an iterator to the end of the first range, and an iterator to the beginning of the range we want to copy into, and an iterator to the end of the range we want to copy into,
- Returns an iterator to the item after where we finished writing to in the copy range.

```
std::vector<int> v1{ 5, 1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 9, 4 };
std::vector<int> v2(6); // Initialize v2 with 6 elements.

std::vector<int>::iterator itStart = v1.begin() + 1;
std::vector<int>::iterator itEnd = v1.end() - 1;

std::partial_sort_copy(itStart, itEnd, v2.begin(), v2.end());

// v2 ends up as { 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
// 5 and 4 are skipped since they aren't in range. v2 is in sorted order.
```

---

### is_sorted

Check whether a given range is sorted.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns a bool. True if the range is sorted, false if it's not sorted.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 7, 2, 1 };

bool isSorted = std::is_sorted(v.begin(), v.end()); // false
```

---

### is_sort_until

Finds the first element in a range that isn't sorted.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns an iterator to the first unsorted element.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 2, 3, 4, 1, 5 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::is_sorted_until(v.begin(), v.end());
// Points to the 1
```

---

### nth_element

For the position that you specify in a range, places the element at that position that would be there if the range was sorted. ("What would the nth element be if this range was sorted" without actually sorting the entire range.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, an iterator to the position we want to find out about, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void. (The range is edited, though.)

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 7, 9, 4 };

// v sorted would be { 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 }

std::vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin() + 1; // 2nd element in v.

std::nth_element(v.begin(), it, v.end());

int element = v[1]; // 4
```

---

# Binary Search

These algorithms are about binary searching O(log N) a sorted range for a value.

---

### lower_bound

Returns an iterator for the lower bound of an element in a range.

"Lower bound" means the first element that is not less than the element we're searching for.

For example, for vector [3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7], lower_bound(4) points to the very first 4 (at index 2).
lower_bound(6) points to 7, since that's the first element not less than 6.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range, and the element you want to search for.
- Returns an iterator to the element. (Or to the container's end if the element doesn't exist.)

```
std::vector<int> v{ 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::lower_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), 4);

int index = it - v.begin(); // 2
```

---

### upper_bound

Returns an iterator for the upper bound of an element in a range.

"Upper bound" means the first element that is greater than the element we're searching for.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range, and the element you want to search for.
- Returns an iterator to the element. (Or to the container's end if the element doesn't exist.)

```
std::vector<int> v{ 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), 4);

int index = it - v.begin(); // 5
```

---

### equal_range

Finds the starting index and ending index for an element in a range. (Meaning if we have duplicates of an item in a container, and we want to find out the range of where those items are.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range, and the element you want to search for.
- Returns an `pair` of iterators of the element type.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 7 };

std::pair<std::vector<int>::iterator, std::vector<int>::iterator> p = std::equal_range(v.begin(), v.end(), 4);

std::vector<int>::iterator startIterator = p.first;
std::vector<int>::iterator endIterator = p.second;

int startIndex = startIterator - v.begin(); // 2
int endIndex = endIterator - v.begin(); // 5
```

---

### binary_search

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 7, 2, 1 };

std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());

bool twoExists = std::binary_search(v.begin(), v.end(), 2); // true
```

---

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the first range, an iterator to the end of the first range, an iterator to the beginning of the second range, an iterator to the end of the second range, and an iterator to the beginning of the resulting range that you want to place all of the data into.
- Returns an iterator to the end of the resulting range after placing the last item into it.

```
std::vector<int> v1{ 1, 3, 5, 9 };
std::vector<int> v2{ 2, 4, 6, 7 };
std::vector<int> res(8);

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::merge(v1.begin(), v1.end(), v2.begin(), v2.end(), res.begin());

// 'it' points to the element after 9 in res
```

---

### inplace_merge

std::inplace_merge(v.begin(), v.begin()+3, v.end());

// v is now { 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 }
```

---

### includes

Check if a given a sorted range contains a second (sorted) range (that you specify). (Ex. Does "abcmopxyz" contain "mop"?)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the first sorted range, an iterator to the end of the first sorted range. an iterator to the beginning of the second sorted range, and an iterator to the second sorted range.
- Returns a bool. True if the first range contains the second range, false if it doesn't.

```
std::string s = "abcmopxyz";
std::string t = "mop";

bool containsMop = std::includes(s.begin(), s.end(), t.begin(), t.end()); // true
```

---

### set_union

Given two sorted ranges, creates a new sorted range from the elements that exist in either range. (The union.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the first range, an iterator to the end of the first range, an iterator to the beginning of the second range, an iterator to the end of the second range, and an iterator to the beginning of the resulting range that you want to place all of the data into.

// res is { 1 1 2 3 4 0 0 } (Zeroes were from the initialization)
// 'it' points to the element after 4 in res.
```

Notice that there are only two 1's in the resulting range. `set_union` will take the maximum number of an element from one range; it won't just add them.

---

### set_intersection

Given two sorted ranges, created a new sorted range from the elements that exist in both ranges. (The intersection.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the first range, an iterator to the end of the first range, an iterator to the beginning of the second range, an iterator to the end of the second range, and an iterator to the beginning of the resulting range that you want to place all of the data into.

std::vector<int> res(7);

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::set_intersection(v1.begin(), v1.end(), v2.begin(), v2.end(), res.begin());

std::vector<int> res(7);

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::set_difference(v1.begin(), v1.end(), v2.begin(), v2.end(), res.begin());

// res is { 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 } (Zeroes were from the initialization)
// 'it' points to the element after 3 in res.
```

---

- Returns an iterator to the element after the last element we placed in the resulting range.

```
std::vector<int> v1{ 1, 2, 3 };
std::vector<int> v2{ 1, 1, 2, 4 };
std::vector<int> res(7);

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::set_symmetric_difference(v1.begin(), v1.end(), v2.begin(), v2.end(), res.begin());

// res is { 1 3 4 0 0 0 0 } (Zeroes were from the initialization)
// 'it' points to the element after 4 in res.
```

Notice the 1 in res. That's there because v2 has an extra 1 that v1 does not have.

# Heap

Algorithms regarding heap data structures.

A "heap" is a binary tree that always has maximum element as the root node (top of the tree). It's used in priority queues. (It can also have the min element as the root.)

---

### make_heap

Rearranges the items in a range so that they form a heap.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };

std::make_heap(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is now { 4 2 3 1 }
```

---

### push_heap

If the first elements of a range are a heap, but the last item isn't, then `push_heap` will place that last item into it's correct position.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 4, 2, 3, 1 }; // v is already a heap.

v.push_back(5); // v is no longer a heap.

std::push_heap(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is now { 5 4 2 3 1 }, which is a heap.
```

---

### pop_heap

Given a range for a heap, places the max element at the end of the range, and rearranges the rest of the elements to be a heap again.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 4, 2, 3, 1 }; // v is a heap.

std::pop_heap(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is now { 4 2 3 1 5 }. (The first 4 elements are a heap.)
```

---

### sort_heap

If a range is a heap, rearrange it into sorted order.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns void.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 4, 2, 3, 1 }; // v is a heap.

std::sort_heap(v.begin(), v.end());

// v is now { 1 2 3 4 5 }.
```

---

### is_heap

Check if a range is a heap.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns a bool. True if the range is a heap, false if it's not a heap.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 4, 2, 3, 1 }; // v is a heap.

bool isHeap = std::is_heap(v.begin(), v.end()); // true
```

---

### is_heap_until

Find the first place in a range that makes the range fail being a heap.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns an iterator to the first element that makes the range fail being a heap.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 200 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::is_heap_until(v.begin(), v.end()); // Points to 200
```

---

# Min and Max

These algorithms are related to finding the minimum/maximum element in a range, or when comparing two items.

---

### min

Compares two items and returns the smaller one.

- Pass in two items (`int`s, for example) as parameters.
- Returns the item's type.

```
int m = std::min(5, 2); // 2
```

---

### max

Compares two items and returns the larger one.

- Pass in two items (`int`s, for example) as parameters.
- Returns the item's type.

```
int m = std::max(5, 2); // 5
```

---

### minmax

Kind of useless in my opinion. Not even going to post the implementation. see `minmax_element` for something useful.

---

### min_element

Returns an iterator to the smallest element for a given range.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns an iterator of the type of the collection.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 7, 2, 1 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::min_element(v.begin(), v.end());

// 'it' points to the 1 in v
```

---

### max_element

Returns an iterator to the largest element for a given range.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns an iterator of the type of the collection.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 7, 2, 1 };

std::vector<int>::iterator it = std::max_element(v.begin(), v.end());

// 'it' points to the 7 in v
```

---

### minmax_element

Returns a `pair` of iterators to the smallest and the largest elements for a given range. (The smallest is the first item, and the largest is the second item.)

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns an `std::pair` of iterators of type of the collection.

```
std::vector<int> v{ 5, 3, 7, 2, 1 };

std::pair<std::vector<int>::iterator, std::vector<int>::iterator> p = std::minmax_element (v.begin(), v.end());

int smallest = *p.first; // 1
int largest = *p.second; // 7
```

---

# Permutations

Permute data into it's next transformation.

### next_permutation

Rearranges the items in the specified range into the next lexographically greater permutation.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns a bool. True if the range was transformed, false otherwise (if there was no such possible permutation).

```
std::string s = "abc";

std::next_permutation(s.begin(), s.end());

// s is now "acb"
```

---

### prev_permutation

Rearranges the items in the specified range into the previous lexographically ordered permutation.

- Pass in an iterator to the beginning of the range, and an iterator to the end of the range.
- Returns a bool. True if the range was transformed, false otherwise (if there was no such possible permutation).

```
std::string s = "acb";

std::prev_permutation(s.begin(), s.end());

// s is now "abc"
```

---

# End Notes

### Notes

- The `auto` keyword was purposely not used often in this documentation, but use it in your real code.

- Note that I say "range" a lot, even though I specifically use `vector.begin()` and `vector.end()` most of the time. Remember that your range can be anywhere in the container you want.

- Some algorithms also have an overloaded version to provide a custom comparator (for example, `stable_sort`), but I've ommitted those to keep the examples short.

- Pay careful attention to the ordering of the parameters, some are not intuitive. (Ex. `nth_element`)
