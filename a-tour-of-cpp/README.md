# A Tour of C++

Codes and drafts about my studies based on the book: *Bjarne Stroustrup, "A Tour of C++", 2nd edition (2018).*

Some solutions (and some comments) are also based on the books:
- Scott Meyers, "Effective C++", 3rd edition (2005).
- Stephen Prata, "C++ Primer Plus", 6th edition (2012).

Each chapter has a folder with some codes, comments, and tests.
All codes were developed on CLion IDE.
