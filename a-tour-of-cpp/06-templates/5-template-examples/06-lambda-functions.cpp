    // In terms of brevity, the functor code is more verbose than the equivalent function or lambda code.

    // One apparent exception would be if you had to use a lambda twice:

    // But you donâ€™t actually have to write out the lambda twice.
    // Essentially, you can create a name for the anonymous lambda and then use the name twice:
    auto lambda_mod7 = [](int x){return x % 7 == 0;}; // lambda_mod7 a name for the lambda
    
    int count7_by_lambda = std::count_if(v.begin(), v.end(), lambda_mod7);

    cout << "count7_by_lambda_again = " << count7_by_lambda_again << endl << endl;
    
    // Thus, we even can use this no-longer-anonymous lambda as an ordinary function:
    bool result = lambda_mod7(10); // result is true if 10 % 7 == 0
    
    
    // We still can use auto for the parameter datatypes, so that the lambda function becomes more generic
    // PS: it does not make sense for this problem, but it is just an example of how to use auto
    auto lambda_mod8 = [](auto x){ return x % 8 == 0; };
    
    
    // Unlike an ordinary function, however, a named lambda can be defined inside a function.
    // The actual type for lambda_mod7 will be some implementation-dependent type that the compiler uses
    // to keep track of lambdas.
