<h1> The Little Boat </h1>
</center>
<p> The storm tossed the little
boat like a cheap sneaker in an
old washing machine. The three
drunken fishermen were used to
such treatment, of course, but
not the tree salesman, who even
as a stowaway now felt that he
had overpaid for the voyage. </p>

<li> Will the salesman die? </li>
<li> What color is the boat? </li>
<li> And what about Naomi? </li>
